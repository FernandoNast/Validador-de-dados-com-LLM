This mission is deeply personal for our CEO, Co-Founder, and Formulator, Ben Goodwin. Like many of us, Ben grew up consuming the Standard American Diet: lots of soda and processed foods that prioritized convenience over nutrition. But at 14, he took his health into his own hands. After making significant changes to his nutrition and exercise, he lost 50 pounds and saw a transformation in his energy, mood, and emotional clarity. Those changes sparked a deep curiosity about the connection between nutrition and health. Ben became a relentless student of the gut microbiome and the ways it supports overall wellness. The more he discovered, the more passionate he became about finding credible, science-backed ways to make consumer health accessible to everyone. The mission was clear. The vehicle? Less so. After exploring the possibilities, Ben landed on an unexpected yet familiar choice: soda. It was something he loved as a kid, and he knew millions shared that same nostalgia. But this wouldn’t be just any soda. With most Americans falling short on daily fiber, Ben set out to create a version with more fiber and less sugar, one that was perfectly balanced. The result? A deliciously refreshing soda with 6 to 9 grams of fiber and 2 to 5 grams of sugar, delivering science-backed benefits without sacrificing the classic taste people crave. In 2018, the first OLIPOP cans hit the shelves, bringing Ben’s vision to life with a functional soda that anyone could enjoy. And by reimagining soda, we’re also reshaping culture. That means creating products that support health for all and building a business grounded in humanistic values: empathy, integrity, and a belief in better for everyone. From the ingredients we source to the culture we foster, we’re committed to proving that business (and beverage!) can be a force for good, and that soda has the power to bring people together. So join us, and let’s write a new American soda story together. One we can all feel good about. One OLIPOP at a time.

OLIPOP has grown from a few passionate people around a table to a nationwide team, and we’ve done it without losing our collaborative spirit or sense of purpose. Connection here is intentional. From cross-functional projects and IRL offsites to thoughtful Slack threads and spontaneous gifs, we make the effort to stay close, even across time zones. Sure, we move quickly, but we lead with trust, transparency, and a shared commitment to doing work that matters. We value thoughtful debate. We give feedback with care and receive it with curiosity, knowing that real growth, both personal and collective, comes from listening as much as leading. Because at OLIPOP, it’s not just about getting things done. It’s about growing together, staying true to what matters, and building something with lasting impact. WHAT WE VALUE At OLIPOP, our values aren’t just posters on a wall. They shape how we show up: for each other, for our customers, and for the mission we’re chasing together. Mission Connectivity : Everything we do ladders up to our shared goal: supporting human health. Whether launching a new flavor or conducting clinical research, the mission stays front and center. Indomitable Spirit : When things get messy, we get inventive. We stay curious, adapt quickly, and find the path forward, most likely with a dedicated Slack thread and a beautifully overbuilt deck. Lead at Every Level : Leadership isn’t about titles, it’s about ownership. We speak up, follow through, and lift each other up. If you’ve got ideas and initiative, you’ve got influence. Courageous Humility: We’re confident in what we bring and curious about what we don’t know (yet). We give feedback with care, take it with grace, and know that real growth takes both. WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR Success at OLIPOP doesn’t come from checking boxes; it comes from living our values, staying curious, and finding energy in both the pace and the purpose. We’re building something big, and we’re looking for people who: Think big, move fast, and take thoughtful risks Thrive in a high-performance, feedback-rich environment Value real human connection and honest collaboration Are fired up by building something new, and making it better every day Startup life at OLIPOP is equally fun and fast-paced.
