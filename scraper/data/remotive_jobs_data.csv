<p><br>We’re Treatwell (hi, hello), and we’re the place to book hair and beauty online. We spend our days working toward our mission to transform the way the hair and beauty community, and their clients, connect. Working isn’t quite the right word though… Our family – yes, we went there – are a collaborative, inspiring, challenging, (modest), group of individuals literally shifting the way the world books hair and beauty. We face our challenges, of course. The biggest one being that 70% of people still book their hair and beauty offline – like phoning the salon or walking straight in. That means, not only do we need a great product, and the right kind of marketing, we need to actually change the mindset of the majority. See? Challenge. With a clear set of values (four specifically; we raise the bar, we put customers first, we are genuinely open, and we work together beautifully), we become a stronger industry leader everyday. But, getting there means constantly evolving our team, and you might be the ideal addition.</p>

<p>At OLIPOP, we’re on a mission to positively impact consumer health at scale. And we’re doing it through something simple: soda. But not just any soda, a new kind of soda: one that’s delicious, refreshing, and actually good for you.</p>
<p>This mission is deeply personal for our CEO, Co-Founder, and Formulator, Ben Goodwin. Like many of us, Ben grew up consuming the Standard American Diet: lots of soda and processed foods that prioritized convenience over nutrition. But at 14, he took his health into his own hands. After making significant changes to his nutrition and exercise, he lost 50 pounds and saw a transformation in his energy, mood, and emotional clarity.</p>
<p>Those changes sparked a deep curiosity about the connection between nutrition and health. Ben became a relentless student of the gut microbiome and the ways it supports overall wellness. The more he discovered, the more passionate he became about finding credible, science-backed ways to make consumer health accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>The mission was clear. The vehicle? Less so. After exploring the possibilities, Ben landed on an unexpected yet familiar choice: soda. It was something he loved as a kid, and he knew millions shared that same nostalgia. But this wouldn’t be just any soda. With most Americans falling short on daily fiber, Ben set out to create a version with more fiber and less sugar, one that was perfectly balanced. The result? A deliciously refreshing soda with 6 to 9 grams of fiber and 2 to 5 grams of sugar, delivering science-backed benefits without sacrificing the classic taste people crave.</p>
<p>In 2018, the first OLIPOP cans hit the shelves, bringing Ben’s vision to life with a functional soda that anyone could enjoy. And by reimagining soda, we’re also reshaping culture. That means creating products that support health for all and building a business grounded in humanistic values: empathy, integrity, and a belief in better for everyone. From the ingredients we source to the culture we foster, we’re committed to proving that business (and beverage!) can be a force for good, and that soda has the power to bring people together.</p>
<p>So join us, and let’s write a new American soda story together. One we can all feel good about. One OLIPOP at a time.</p>

<p>We may be fully remote, but we’re anything but disconnected. OLIPOP has grown from a few passionate people around a table to a nationwide team, and we’ve done it without losing our collaborative spirit or sense of purpose.</p>
<p>Connection here is intentional. From cross-functional projects and IRL offsites to thoughtful Slack threads and spontaneous gifs, we make the effort to stay close, even across time zones. Sure, we move quickly, but we lead with trust, transparency, and a shared commitment to doing work that matters.</p>
<p>We value thoughtful debate. We give feedback with care and receive it with curiosity, knowing that real growth, both personal and collective, comes from listening as much as leading. Because at OLIPOP, it’s not just about getting things done. It’s about growing together, staying true to what matters, and building something with lasting impact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>WHAT WE VALUE</em></strong></p>
<p>At OLIPOP, our values aren’t just posters on a wall. They shape how we show up: for each other, for our customers, and for the mission we’re chasing together. </p>
<ul style="""">
<li style=""""><strong>Mission Connectivity</strong>: Everything we do ladders up to our shared goal: supporting human health. Whether launching a new flavor or conducting clinical research, the mission stays front and center.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Indomitable Spirit</strong>: When things get messy, we get inventive. We stay curious, adapt quickly, and find the path forward, most likely with a dedicated Slack thread and a beautifully overbuilt deck.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Lead at Every Level</strong>: Leadership isn’t about titles, it’s about ownership. We speak up, follow through, and lift each other up. If you’ve got ideas and initiative, you’ve got influence.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Courageous Humility: </strong>We’re confident in what we bring and curious about what we don’t know (yet). We give feedback with care, take it with grace, and know that real growth takes both.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR</em></strong></p>
<p>Success at OLIPOP doesn’t come from checking boxes; it comes from living our values, staying curious, and finding energy in both the pace and the purpose. We’re building something big, and we’re looking for people who: </p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">Think big, move fast, and take thoughtful risks</li>
<li style="""">Thrive in a high-performance, feedback-rich environment</li>
<li style="""">Value real human connection and honest collaboration</li>
<li style="""">Are fired up by building something new, and making it better every day</li>
</ul>

<p>Zencoder is building the next generation of AI coding agents — advanced tools that supercharge developer workflows and elevate engineering impact. Our mission is to transform how software is built by equipping developers with AI-powered tools that boost productivity, improve code quality, and unlock creativity.</p>
<p>Our product integrates seamlessly with JetBrains IDEs and VS Code, helping developers generate, refactor, and repair code. It includes fast and intelligent AI code completion, and our agents can independently perform tasks like running shell commands or searching the web to assist with coding and debugging. We're especially proud of our proprietary Repo Grokking™ technology, which enables our AI agents to deeply understand your entire codebase, providing the strongest contextual understanding on the market. Zencoder also connects with 20+ popular tools like Jira, Sentry, GitHub, and GitLab, making it the most integrated AI coding solution available.</p>
<p>This is just a small part of what Zencoder is all about. There’s much more to discover — and we’re just getting started.</p></div><div class=""h2""><strong>🛠️ What You’re Getting Into</strong></div>
<p>We’re looking for a <strong>Senior Data Analyst</strong> to help us shape how we collect, analyze, and act on data across our AI-powered coding platform. You’ll build scalable data infrastructure, design high-quality data models, help evaluate our agents, and make sure decision-makers have the insights they need — from engineers to product managers to the founder.</p>
<p>You’ll be joining a small but ambitious Data &amp; Analytics team on the ground floor. This is a rare opportunity to set the foundation for analytics at a fast-moving AI company led by serial founder Andrew Filev (ex-Wrike), where your work directly impacts the future of how software is built.</p>
<div class=""h2"">🔍 What You’ll Do</div>

<li style="""">Develop and implement standardized processes for tracking new analytical events;</li>
<li style="""">Turn raw data into real insights — dig into product usage, agent performance, and user behavior to help teams understand what’s working, what’s not, and where to go next.</li>
<li style="""">Level up our analytics game by improving our reporting systems and introducing new metrics that reflect how users experience our AI tools.</li>
<li style="""">Build trust in our data with robust quality checks and validation processes.</li>
<li style="""">Architect DWH data models, create and optimize SQL queries and data models for cross-layer DWH data transformation using DBT.</li>
</ul>
<div class=""h2"">🧰 Tech Details</div>
<p>Our current toolkit includes <strong>Amplitude, GCS, BigQuery, DBT, and Python</strong>, but we’re not locked in. You’ll help shape the architecture and pick the right tools as we scale.</p>
<p>We work with <strong>massive, AI-specific data</strong> like prompts and user content — not just pageviews and clicks. There’s very little legacy, so you won’t spend your days untangling old pipelines. Instead, you’ll be laying the groundwork for a data platform that powers the future of AI development.</p>

<li style="""">No Busywork: We cut out the noise so you can focus on solving interesting problems.</li>
